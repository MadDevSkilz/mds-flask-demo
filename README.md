# mds-flask-demo
Learn to use Flask with Python 3 to make a RESTful API in Fewer than 10 Minutes

I use this demo code in a lot of videos.  To use it, clone it, then set up a virtual environment, activate it, and install flask with pip.

```
pip install flask
```

To run it, you need to either set the FLASK_APP environment variable, which is the subject of this video:

Or, you need to supply the file name containing the app:

```
flask run mds-flask-demo.py
```
